# Welcome to Radiomics Features Extraction for TCIA ISPY2 Images

This workflow was created as part of Henry Fessler's final project for CMSE-890-602 Reproducible Computational Workflows. 


# Workflow Summary

This workflow takes the identifying information for a patient and imaging event from the [ISPY2 Image Collection](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70230072) and provides the radiomics for that imaging event. 

For a more complete view of the workflow please see the [psuedocode](psuedocode.md) or [dataflow diagram](dfd.md). 

To run the workflow please see the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md). To check your installation, please see the [testing guide](testing.md). For more details on the package requirements, please see the [installation details](installation.md).
